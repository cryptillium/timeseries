# timeseries

## Background

The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business. As a result, they are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.

## purpose and objectives
This project will use many time series techniques to analyse and predict future movements in the value of the JPY/USD pair and determine the risk associated with the currency and whether or not we should purchase based on the results.
